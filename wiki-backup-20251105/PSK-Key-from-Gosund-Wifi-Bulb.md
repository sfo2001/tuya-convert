Hi, I had the same problem with flashing a new software over ota to my **Gosund Wifi Bulb**.

I didn't get it to run, so I read out the image from the esp.


Here is my result: [ stand: 27.12.2020 ]
{"mac_addr":"40f520e36176","prod_idx":"30137612","auz_key":"FTyAW7cIRElS5rmBbAyMyH3XFOHLC5mv","pskKey":"EfGJW5OOaRYBJ4ffRX4Ck32CdCnZjcu54jd3g","prod_test":false}

I didn't managed to include it into the flashing software.

So i flashed it manually with the programming pins on the board.

for questions feel free to ask me
