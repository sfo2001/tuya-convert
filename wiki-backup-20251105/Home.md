Welcome to the Wiki!

Please have a look at the list of compatible devices:
* [HTTP (old) firmware](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/wiki/Compatible-devices-(HTTP-firmware))
* [HTTPS (new) firmware](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/wiki/Compatible-devices-(HTTPS-firmware))

Have you flashed a light bulb with Tasmota and somehow entered the wrong Wi-Fi password? Fear not! [There is a possible solution](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Device-Recovery/)!!!
